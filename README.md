This program runs a simple tic-tac-toe game displayed in a GUI window. I made this because I was interested in creating a game but wanted to keep it simple to practice using the Tkinter library, since I focused on that in my last two projects. I created it by applying the skills I learned from the calculator and to-do list I recently made using the Tkinter library. Throughout the process, I used online resources such as Google and YouTube to fill in gaps in my understanding. One specific challenge I faced was a bug that caused the program to add score points even when the game ended in a draw. After doing research, referring to multiple sources, and experimenting with different solutions, I was able to fix the problem.
